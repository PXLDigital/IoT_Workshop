# Getting Started

If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request (PR) with a fix. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create a branch, which can be found within the issue under "Development." This will connect the issue and branch.
1. You may start a pull request immediately, as commits within the branch's PR will automatically be added to the PR.
1. Within the PR, you can ask questions, request or add information, or ask for a review of the pull request. To get the teacher's attention, use @mention.
1. The teacher will review the information and close the PR if it is completed.

> If you don't have write acces, discuss with your teacher or fork the repository. Pull request between the forked and original repositories are also possible.

# Pull Request Requirements

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number, if you didn't create a branch/PR from within the issue. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information. **We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged.**

# Opening an Issue

If you've found a bug, want to contribute to the documentation, add a new feature, or change an existing one, ensure it hasn't already been reported by searching in the repo under "Issues." If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

- Consider starting the title with the label of the solution you're contributing to (e.g., [TwinCAT] or [VISION]). Most of the solution names can be found as folders within the root.
- Include a clear description. You may want to write it in Dutch if it's easier for you to communicate. This way, you can be sure the issue is understood correctly.
- Add as much relevant information as possible and proof of the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone.

> All issues should be linked to the [GitHub project "Professional Skills](https://github.com/orgs/PXLDigital/projects/18/views/1)."
